### About Me
* * *

I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the Courant Institute, NYU. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Rajesh Ranganath](https://cims.nyu.edu/~rajeshr/).
I will be supported by the [Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD fellowship](https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/apple-scholars-aiml-2022).

At present, I'm working on building models that are robust across populations using insights and techniques from causal inference.
Earlier, I worked on causal effect estimation when standard assumptions like ignorability and positivity/overlap do not hold and improving calibration in survival models.
My primary applied interest is ML for healthcare in particular and science in general.


I'm eternally excited about new ideas and finding good applications for my work! Shoot me an email if you want to chat!

I was an intern in the summer of 2019 in Adobe Research, San Jose working on bayesian attribution models for ad targeting. Previously, I worked as a Software Developer at [DBMI, Columbia University](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/). In 2017, I completed my MS in CS, also at NYU. I was introduced to causal inference in the [Clinical Machine Learning group](clinicalml.org), where I worked with two amazing mentors, [Prof. Uri Shalit](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/en/people/userprofile/urishalit.html) and [Prof. David Sontag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/). My fateful but fun undergrad was from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in), where I was enrolled in the EE department.
