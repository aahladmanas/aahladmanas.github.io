Notes from this paper: 

## Questions to answer:

1. What is Polyak acceleration? Nesterov? General momentum?
2. Where does momentum really help? Just lightly sloped surfaces?
3. Why do gradient normalization per weight?
4. The inferred gradient descent algorithm from [Self-Tuning Stochastic Optimization with Curvature-Aware Gradient Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04803)
