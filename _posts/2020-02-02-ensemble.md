Notes from this paper: 

## What is an ensemble?

An ensemble is a collection of models equipped with a way to aggregate the outputs of each model to produce a prediction.

For example, an ensemble $$\{f_i\}_{i\leq N}$$ that averages the outputs of each model to predict will be $$f_e(x_i) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i f_i(x_i).$$

## What is few shot learning?

Few shot learning aims to replicate the human quality being able to classify based a small number of examples to a model. Humans do this due to the amazing visual cortex that is able to differentiate between complex shapes by quickly breaking them down into simple ones; humans do not start from scratch (quote by Chelsea Finn [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq40Bze_hMA&list=PLdDZb3TwJPZ4Ri6i0MIdesIEpYK4lx17Q&index=8)). How do we build such abilities (like breaking down into simple shapes) into a model?

Few-shot learning says hello.
