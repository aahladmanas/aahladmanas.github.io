## What is an ensemble?

An ensemble is a collection of models equipped with a way to aggregate the outputs of each model to produce a prediction.

For example, an ensemble $$\{f_i\}_{i\leq N}$$ that averages the outputs of each model to predict will be $$f_e(x_i) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i f_i(x_i)$$.
